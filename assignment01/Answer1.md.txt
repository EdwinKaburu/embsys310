# Embedded Device Example 
### Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents.

 - [ ] How it Works
 - There are numerous embedded systems technologies out there, most have become part of our daily life, for instance the microwave in your kitchen. 
 - The microwave, in the kitchen, main functionality is to heat/ radiate certain matter (food in our kitchen context, you can (not recommend) insert a Cd for an experiment !!); by exposing it to the microwave frequency range in the electromagnetic spectrum.
 - It has over time through the generations, expanded its functionalities by having a built in, clock/timer interface settings, power levels, cooking preferences (popcorn, backed potatoes, etc... ), and recently network connectivity (smart microwaves) to name the few. 
 - These are mostly functionalities that are acted upon by the keypad/sensors inputs from both internal and external factors. 
 - [ ] Design Challenges
 - As such there are relatively few design challenges for the embedded system, however when a network connectivity (IoT [smart microwave]) is involved, some of challenges might include, data organization and management that goes in hand with the memory capacity, and security. 
 - Reliability (the system must be able to handle scenarios brought upon by the actions of the user or hardware), is one of the design challenges that is universal to both system (network connected or not).
 - Power consumption is another, in the context of translating commands given accordingly (  for instance you wouldn't want a microwave that added 10 minutes to your preferred cooking time repeatedly, it would be damaging to your food and you will have lengthy monthly electrical bills, it will also undermine reliability).
